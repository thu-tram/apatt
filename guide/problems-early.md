# start solving problems as soon as possible

I've spent more than a thousand hours working with students of all different levels on their programming skills over the past two years. The ones who struggle the most have one thing in common: when faced with a new problem, they don't know where to start. Here's why I think that happens, and how you can avoid it.

When you're first learning how to program, you're learning two skills:

1. How to problem solve, which involves breaking down a problem into smaller steps that when followed, lead to the solution

2. How to express those steps using a programming language. This involves learning the rules and syntax of that programming language.

These are two distinct skills. We solve problems by breaking them down into smaller steps all the time without programming languages (for example, when we’re cooking, or calculating how to split a bill). You can also know the rules and syntax of a programming language perfectly and still write a program that is incapable of solving anything (as I have done many times). But because both skills are required to produce programs that do anything useful, beginners have to learn both skills at the same time.

This is actually a challenge because there is A LOT to learn about the rules and syntax of a programming language. I learn new things about JavaScript every time I use it. And because there is so much to learn about rules and syntax, it can **feel** like learning rules and syntax is everything you need to learn, while completely ignoring the skill of problem solving. (In addition, most instructional content focuses on rules and syntax, since it easier to teach than general problem solving).

This is what happen whenever we (beginners especially!) follow tutorials and simply copy the code we see. Most tutorials are very good at showing the commands and instructions you need to run in order to get something working, but they don't teach all thinking that went into figuring out what those instructions are.

So when you're starting to programing, **you have to start solving problems on your own, as soon as possible**. These problems will be small at first, but it’s crucial you at least try all the stages of what I call the "problem solving cycle" - starting from breaking down the problem into smaller steps, to evaluating how correct those steps are, to finally, opening up your code editor and writing those steps using a programming language - on your own.

Two resources I recommend are [https://www.codewars.com](https://www.codewars.com/) and [https://codestepbystep.com/](https://codestepbystep.com/). Codestepbystep in particular has very good exercises for all levels of beginners. Both sites have a bunch of small practice problems where you can practice the "problem solving cycle" on your own.

Follow this process. Say you are learning for-loops. First find some resources to learn the rules and syntax. Then, find immediately problems that require using for-loops to solve the problem. (This will improve both your problem solving skills and your grasp of the rules and syntax of for-loops). By following this process, you'll build the foundations to solve increasingly complex problems (such as the data structures and algorithms on leetcode) with increasingly powerful technologies (React, Docker), which happen to be the skills that get you paid.

And when you are trying to solve those problems, try to understand how each step contributes to the overall problem (articulating each step out loud or writing them out in plain english helps a lot here!).

**Expect to get stuck from time and time**. Being stuck is good! If you are stuck but then make progress, either on your own or by asking others, that means you are learning.

After doing so a few times, you'll notice that reading for a new exercise will **start to immediately trigger** thoughts of what the first few steps should look like. With more and more practice, the steps you immediately think of will start to lead closer to the final solution, and you’ll be able to express them using a programming language with ease.

I've been thinking about how to teach general problem solving, so let me know if you are interested in learning more about that!

Hope this helps,
