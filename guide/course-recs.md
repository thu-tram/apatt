Skip shallow tutorials. Start with a real introduction to computer science that builds thinking skills, not just syntax.

Top picks:

- [CS50's Introduction to Computer Science](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/) (Harvard) — free, engaging, problem-focused. Teaches algorithmic thinking and efficient problem-solving from zero.
- [OSSU's Introduction to Computer Science path](https://cs.ossu.dev/coursepages/intro-cs/) — uses MIT's Python-based intro (or CS50) to cover computation fundamentals and small-program confidence. Beginner-friendly, concept-driven.
